  abstract = "Drug-likeness is a key consideration when selecting compounds
              during the early stages of drug discovery. However, evaluation of
              drug-likeness in absolute terms does not reflect adequately the
              whole spectrum of compound quality. More worryingly, widely used
              rules may inadvertently foster undesirable molecular property
              inflation as they permit the encroachment of rule-compliant
              compounds towards their boundaries. We propose a measure of
              drug-likeness based on the concept of desirability called the
              quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED). The empirical
              rationale of QED reflects the underlying distribution of
              molecular properties. QED is intuitive, transparent,
              straightforward to implement in many practical settings and
              allows compounds to be ranked by their relative merit. We
              extended the utility of QED by applying it to the problem of
              molecular target druggability assessment by prioritizing a large
              set of published bioactive compounds. The measure may also
              capture the abstract notion of aesthetics in medicinal chemistry.",

Since its introduction in 2009, ChEMBL’s content has changed dramatically in size and diversity of data types. Through incorporation of multiple new datasets from depositors since the 2019 update, ChEMBL now contains slightly more bioactivity data from deposited data vs data extracted from literature. In collaboration with the EUbOPEN consortium, chemical probe data is now regularly deposited into ChEMBL. Release 27 made curated data available for compounds screened for potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity from several large-scale drug repurposing screens. In addition, new patent bioactivity data have been added to the latest ChEMBL releases, and various new features have been incorporated, including a Natural Product likeness score, updated flags for Natural Products, a new flag for Chemical Probes, and the initial annotation of the action type for ∼270 000 bioactivity measurements.}",

It has only recently been possible to extend protein structure prediction to two hundred million cataloged proteins. Characterizing the structures of the exponentially growing billions of protein sequences revealed by large scale gene sequencing experiments would necessitate a break-through in the speed of folding. Here we show that direct inference of structure from primary sequence using a large language model enables an order of magnitude speed-up in high resolution structure prediction. Leveraging the insight that language models learn evolutionary patterns across millions of sequences, we train models up to 15B parameters, the largest language model of proteins to date. As the language models are scaled they learn information that enables prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein at the resolution of individual atoms. This results in prediction that is up to 60x faster than state-of-the-art while maintaining resolution and accuracy. Building on this, we present the ESM Metage-nomic Atlas. This is the first large-scale structural characterization of metagenomic proteins, with more than 617 million structures. The atlas reveals more than 225 million high confidence predictions, including millions whose structures are novel in comparison with experimentally determined structures, giving an unprecedented view into the vast breadth and diversity of the structures of some of the least understood proteins on earth.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

  abstract = "The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by
              severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
              emphasized the urgency to develop effective therapeutics. Drug
              repurposing screening is regarded as one of the most practical
              and rapid approaches for the discovery of such therapeutics. The
              3C-like protease (3CLpro), or main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2
              is a valid drug target as it is a specific viral enzyme and plays
              an essential role in viral replication. We performed a
              quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) of 10 755 compounds
              consisting of approved and investigational drugs, and bioactive
              compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro assay. Twenty-three small
              molecule inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have been identified
              with IC50s ranging from 0.26 to 28.85 $\mu$M. Walrycin B (IC50 =
              0.26 $\mu$M), hydroxocobalamin (IC50 = 3.29 $\mu$M), suramin

              are the most potent 3CLpro inhibitors. The activity of the
              anti-SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was confirmed in 7 of 23
              compounds using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay. The results
              demonstrated a set of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro inhibitors that may have
              potential for further clinical evaluation as part of drug
              combination therapies to treating COVID-19 patients and as

               needed for the processing of PP1A and PP1AB polyproteins. The
               main protease 3CL (chemotripsine-like) gives rise to the
               formation of NSP11/16 proteins. The 3CL protease has been
               constituted as one of the possible therapeutic targets for the
               development of antiviral drugs against SARS-COV-2 due to its
               highly conserved sequence and structure among all coronaviruses.
               During the SARS-COV-1 pandemic, a hydroxymethyl ketone
               derivative (PF-00835231) was identified with an intense
               inhibitory activity against the 3CL protease. Subsequent
               chemical modifications gave rise to derivative PF-07321332
               (nirmatrelvir) which has shown a high antiviral efficacy against
               SARS-COV-2. The company's data indicate that it is capable of
               reducing 89\% the risk of hospitalization and death of patients
               infected with hardly adverse effects. Its effectiveness improves
               if it is administered orally in the first 24-48 hours and the
               duration of treatment has been established between 3-5 days. The
               commercial form has been associated with the antiviral ritonavir
               that has shown the metabolism of nirmatrelvir, lengthening its
               average life. This antiviral would be effective against current
               and future viral variants, since 3CL is not modified in them.
               The FDA approved this antiviral in November 2021 and EMA is in
               the final evaluation phase.",

ABSTRACT = {The main protease (Mpro) plays a pivotal role in the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is considered a highly conserved viral target. Disruption of the catalytic activity of Mpro produces a detrimental effect on the course of the infection, making this target one of the most attractive for the treatment of COVID-19. The current success of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor Nirmatrelvir, the first oral drug for the treatment of severe forms of COVID-19, has further focused the attention of researchers on this important viral target, making the search for new Mpro inhibitors a thriving and exciting field for the development of antiviral drugs active against SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviruses.},
